In this repository, you will find a collection of artifacts crafted during my dedicated journey through the standfort course '[CS193p](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2023)' as part of my non-obligatory preparation for my internship. This repository also acts as data storage and to present the my completed work. 
The goal of this course was to create a card game in swiftUI.
